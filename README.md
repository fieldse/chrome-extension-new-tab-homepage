## Purpose

I like to open a custom locally stored homepage when opening new browser tabs, instead of hitting a server every time,

Even with caching, this should be snappier than loading a remote page as your New Tab, and is more customizeable than the default Chrome/Brave browser New Tab page.

## Browser compatibility

Should work on recent versions of Chrome & Brave Browsers.

## Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browswer, and click the Developer mode checkbox on the top right.
2. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button
3. Navigate to your folder and click select

## Technical details

Uses:

- Node 16
- TailwindCSS

## Customization

Build your own! You can customize the new new tab page or build your own from scratch.

Requirements:

- Node 16+

Steps:

1. Install: `npm install`
2. Start the styles builder: `npm run build:watch`
3. Modify the page: edit the contents of `/src/index.html` to your liking.

Styles are built to `/src/css/style.css`
