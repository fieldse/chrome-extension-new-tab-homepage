## Purpose

I like to open a custom locally stored homepage when opening new browser tabs, instead of hitting a server every time,

Even with caching, this should be snappier than loading a remote page as your New Tab, and is more customizeable than the default Chrome/Brave browser New Tab page.

Build your own page!

## Customization

Edit the content of `custom-tab.html` to your liking.

Styles are in `css/style.css`

## Compatibility

Should work on recent versions of Chrome & Brave Browsers.

## Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in your browswer, and click the Developer mode checkbox on the top right.
2. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button
3. Navigate to your folder and click select
